/status
    -> get - backend check

/client
    -> get - retrieve client ID, used to "fingerprint" extensions to acheive consistency even when removed. Probably using cookies.

    Problem is that when extension removed, it will delete anything in it's cache and thereby forget who it is. 
    Therefore it should call home to see if it already has a clientId before asking for a new one.

    -> get /{clientId} - retrieve information for this clientId

        { status: 'ok', hasUnblockers: 0, clientId: 'xyz', name: null }

    Mechanism whereby client can get updated information from server.

    -> post - ask for a new ID to use in further communications. (needs rate limiting, probably only allow once every 5 minutes per IP)

    If all else fails, or on initial install, we need to ask for a new clientId... perhaps this is all just session 
    management???

/unblocker
    -> get /{unblockerId}
    -> post /{unblockerId}
